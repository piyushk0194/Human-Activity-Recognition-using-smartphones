# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-smartphones

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.

Data Type
csv files
Train.csv (Triaxial acceleration, estimated body acceleration, Triaxial Angular velocity, a 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables, activity label)
Test.csv it is same as train.csv except the label is missing which we need to predict
